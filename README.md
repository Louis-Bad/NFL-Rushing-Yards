This project contains the analysis of the aspects that make a run play successful, and a model that can predict the yards that will be gained on the next run play. All of the data used can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2020/overview) <br>
The ticket sales, corporate sposnors and concessions can contribute to over ***50%*** of a teams annual revenue and a teams fan base is a large driver of these profitable transasctions. A winning team can attract new fans and appease exiting ones; and more fans can create larger profit margins. This project aims to assist NFL teams in their play calling effectiveness and increase their odds of winning. <br>

## Executive Summary

#### The aims:
1. *To utilise statistical analysis in order to provide a better understanding of what contributes to a successful run play.*
2. *To build a model that will predict the yards gained by the next run play.*

#### Why this matters:
1. *NFL teams are franchises, and winning teams can generate more profits*

    NFL teams are franchises. Because of this, like any other franchise or business, the bottom line often comes down to its profits and the annual increase of those profits. The National Football League split their revenue into two categories: 'national revenue' and 'local revenue'. The national revenue, consists of the profits made by the NFL by way of licensing and merchandising deals. These profits are then evenly distributed among each of the 32 NFL teams. <br>
    
    Conversely, the local revenue generated from ticket sales, corporate sponsors and concessions are earned by the teams themselves. According to an [article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robreischel/2018/07/16/green-bay-packers-enjoy-another-year-of-record-revenue/#4347ecae14bb) on Forbes Business, in 2018 the Green Bay Packers *"local revenue increased to 199 million dollars"* accounting for around ***44%*** of their total revenue that year. Teams that generate more of a fan following, and in turn a larger scope of influence will have more bargaining power for these streams of local revenue. In addition to the potential profits from winning the playoffs and becoming the league champions, a winning team stands more chance of a greater fan following and thus greater potential for an increase in profit margins.

2. *A dominant run game can win games*

    To win you need to score, to score you need to get the ball into the end zone, and to get the ball into the end zone you need to move the ball farther up the field. With a run play being one out of the two options an offence has to try and move closer to the end zone, optimising this aspect of their game could lead to considerable improvements in a teams win percentage. In an [article](https://www.nfl.com/news/running-the-football-still-works-plus-the-amari-cooper-effect-0ap3000000996948) by the renowned NFL analyst, former player and scout, Bucky Brooks states that: <br>
    *“From Weeks 11-13, teams that ranked in the top half of the NFL in terms of run-play percentage posted a combined record of 32-13 (71.1 winning percentage). On the flip side, teams that ranked in the bottom half of the league in this category logged a combined mark of 12-31 (27.9)”* <br>

In this project I have provided insightful analysis into the aspects of a successful run game and designed a model that will predict the yards gained on the next run play. The implementation of such a model is expected to improve the play calling efficiency of an offensive team and as a result lead to an increased win percentage.

## The Data
<p align="center">
<img height=450 width=450 src="references/images/run_play_proportion.png">
</p>

We can see here that almost all of the runs in the dataset are by the Running Backs on the offense, contributing to 93% of the total run plays. It could be argued that this should be rounded to 96% as the HB (Half Back) position is a specific type of running back. <br>

This to be expected as running with the ball (as the name suggests) is the RB's primary role on the team. Because of this the modelling of the data will be based on the cases where it is the RB who is running with the ball and any other player who ran with the ball will be treated as an edge case.
